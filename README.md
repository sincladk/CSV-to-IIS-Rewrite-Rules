# CSV to IIS Rewrite Rules
This tiny console application takes a simple CSV file and generates a `<rewrite>` XML block that can be inserted into a web.config file on an IIS server that supports the IIS Rewrite module.

## Usage
`CsvToIisRewriteRules.exe <csv-file-path> <output-directory> [-s]`

### Command line parameters

#### CSV File Path
Specify the path to the CSV file. The file must be in the following format:

```
http://source-domain.com/source/page-1,https://destination-domain.com/destination/page-1
http://source-domain.com/source/page-2,https://destination-domain.com/destination/page-2
```

#### Output directory
The directory into which to write the config file(s) generated by the application.

#### Separate Config Files (`-s`)
If `-s` is specified, the config files will be broken out as follows:

##### `rewriteMaps.config`
This file contains the `<rewriteMaps/>` element, containing all the `<rewriteMap/>` elements and their individual rewrites.

##### `rules.config`
This file contains the `<rules/>` element, containing all the rules which reference the rewrite maps.

##### `rewrite.config`
This file contains references to the `rewriteMaps.config` and `rules.config` files generated above.

> Note: this file is the default file that is generated and will contain all configuration if the `-s` parameter is not specified.
